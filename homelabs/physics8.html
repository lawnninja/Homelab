            <b>Theoretical notes:</b> All materials are made up from atoms, and all atoms consist of
        protons, neutrons and electrons. Protons have a positive electrical charge. Neutrons
        have no electrical charge (that is they are Neutral), while Electrons have a negative
        electrical charge. Atoms are bound together by powerful forces of attraction existing
        between the atoms nucleus and the electrons in its outer shell. When these protons,
        neutrons and electrons are together within the atom they are happy and stable. But if
        we separate them from each other they want to reform and start to exert a potential of
        attraction called a potential difference.<br>
            Now if we create a closed circuit these loose electrons will start to move and drift back
        to the protons due to their attraction creating a flow of electrons. This flow of electrons
        is called an electrical current. The electrons do no flow freely through the circuit as the
        material they move through creates a restriction to the electron flow. This restriction is
        called resistance. Besides the resistance, the electric current is defined by another two
        physical measures: Voltage and Current. The voltage is defined as the work done by the
        current over the electric charge, representing the potential of the circuit. The current is
        the number of charges that pass through a conductor in a fixed amount of time and
        could be thought of as some kind of "velocity" of the charges.

        The electric component whose job is to limit the
        current that passes through a conductor is called a
        resistor. Because of the properties of the electric
        current, it behaves differently depending on the way
        the resistors are connected. There are two types of
        resistor connections: parallel connection and series
        connection. We say two or more resistors are
        connected in series when the same current passes
        through all the resistors. This means the current
        enters the second resistor as soon as it exits the
        first one. Here is an example of series connection:

                In order to see a live result,
                we are going to use LEDs
                instead of resistors. The
                longer leg of the LED is the
                anode, meaning it connects
                to +. The shorter leg is the
                cathode and should be

                The 3V battery will be the
                source of the current. the
                red wire is the + of the
                source and the black wire is
                the - terminal of the
